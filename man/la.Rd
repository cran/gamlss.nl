\details{ The blood flow data were analyzed by Lange {\it
et al.} (1989), Jones and Faddy (2003) and Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2006). 
As response variables y the variables PET60, PETother, PET510
can be used representing  blood flow
measured non-invasively by positron emission tomography using a scan
up to 60 seconds (PET60) or 510 second (PET510) respectively.  The explanatory variable x is the blood
flow measured invasively using radioactively labelled micro-spheres.
The distribution of y has previously been modelled by a normal (NO) and a  {\it t} family
distribution (TF), Lange {\it et al.} (1989), and by a skew {\it t}
distribution (ST), Jones and Faddy (2003) and by Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2006) using several three and four parameter distributions, 
including the Box-Cox power exponential (BCPE), Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2004) and the Box-Cox t diastribution (BCT) .
